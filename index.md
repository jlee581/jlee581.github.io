# About Me
I'm a first year PhD student in [Computer Science](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. I'm a member of the Machine Learning for Data-Driven Decisions ([MLD<sup>3</sup>](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/)) research group led by [Professor Jenna Wiens](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/). My research focuses on how machine learning and data-intensive computing methods could be utilized to solve complex biomedical problems. 

Here is my [CV](Lee-JungMin-CV.pdf).
