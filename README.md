I'm a first year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I'm a member of the Machine Learning for Data-Driven Decisions research group led by Professor Jenna Wiens. My research focuses on how machine learning and data-intensive computing methods could be utilized to solve complex biomedical problems.
